Introduction
============

This package makes `Products.CMFEditions`_ works with `Dexterity`_ content types.

In general CMFEditions works ok with Dexterity. The only problem is the ``versions_history_form``
template: it does not show the older versions for Dexterity content items. Also, it may break if
the custom content type does not use the default view auto-generated by Dexterity.

This package solve this problem by overriding ``versions_history_form``.

Installation
============

The usual: add this package to the buildout and install the Generic Setup profile in the Plone Site.

Extension/customization points
==============================

To make the ``versions_history_form`` template work with Dexterity content types some views were
created. These can be overriden to customize the way older versions of a content type are displayed:

- ``@@download-version``: Downloads an older version of a file stored in a ``plone.namedfile``
  field.
- ``@@content-core``: Render only the ``content-core`` div of the default view of a content item.  
- ``@@version-view``: Same as ``@@content-core`` but makes links to file downloads use the 
  ``@@download-version`` view.
